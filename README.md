# AI-Timetable-Builder

This project, written in Java, demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence techniques to generate a school timetable based on input data from two text files (teachers and lessons). The Hill Climbing heuristic search algorithm is employed to accomplish this task. This project was created as a university assignment for an "Artificial Intelligence" course.
